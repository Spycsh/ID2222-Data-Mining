Basic Task

You are to solve the first sub-problem: to implement the A-Priori algorithm for finding frequent itemsets with support at least s in a dataset of sales transactions. Remind that support of an itemset is the number of transactions containing the itemset. To test and evaluate your implementation, write a program that uses your A-Priori algorithm implementation to discover frequent itemsets with support at least s in a given dataset of sales transactions.

The implementation can be done using any big data processing framework, such as Apache Spark, Apache Flink, or no framework, e.g., in Java, Python, etc.

Bonus task

Solve the second sub-problem, i.e., develop and implement an algorithm for generating association rules between frequent itemsets discovered by using the A-Priori algorithm in a dataset of sales transactions. The rules must have support at least s and confidence at least c, where s and c are given as input parameters.
