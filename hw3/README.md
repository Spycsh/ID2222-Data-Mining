First, implement the reservoir Flajolet-Martin algorithm used in the graph algorithm presented in the paper you have selected;
Second, implement the streaming graph algorithm presented in the paper that make use of the algorithm implemented in the first step.
To ensure that your implementation is correct, you are to test your implementation with some of the publicly available graph datasets (find a link below), and present your test results in a report.
